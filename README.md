# <Weather-App>

## Description

- The goal was to deploy a simple weather app that a user could input a city name the ui would display the current weather as well as a basic 5-day forecast
- I built this project to practice fetch requests from 3rd party server APIs
- This allows me to develop web application that don't soley rely on the data stored within the source code.
- I learned how to make dynamic fetch requests based off of the server response
- I learned how to use the native Date() method vs a 3rd party such as dayjs
- I learned how to use vanilla js to interact with bootstrap modals instead of relying on jquery
